This theme is based on top of mkdocs-basic-theme.

https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs-basic-theme


## Summary of understanding

The documentation around templating is pretty good. It is all on one page :)
https://www.mkdocs.org/dev-guide/themes/#navigation-objects

There are 2 global variables on each page:
`nav` and `toc`

Nav is an iterable of 3 kinds of page: `section`, `page` and `link`
